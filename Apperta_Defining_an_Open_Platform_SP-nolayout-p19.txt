Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

and care purposes something between
these two extremes is required. An
example candidate is the GOV.UK Verify
service. An open platform may choose to
provide access to this type of service as an
“Assured Identity Service” for its users.
2. Authorisation
Authorisation is concerned with the
authority an individual has. Authorisation
can be described in general terms:

Is individual “I” allowed to perform action
“A” on an object “O”?
This may include i’s authority to access
data or perform an action on a particular
patient or service user. Alternatively,
authorisation might capture a data
subjects consents for particular uses
of data or actions. The rights to grant
authorisations and consents sit with
a multitude of entities including both
individuals and organisations. The open
platform may choose to provide the
assured records of such authorisations as
a “Service” for its users.

3. Authentication
Authentication is concerned with
the technical measures that allow
an individual to access and use their
identity credentials, e.g. passwords, keys,
biometrics, etc. Authentication is typically
achieved by proving some combination of
one or more of:
•	 Something they know - a password or
secret;
•	 Something they have - a key, a smart
card, or some other unique device; and
or
•	 Something about them - a fingerprint, a
voice print or other biometric.
Authentication services are a core part of
an open platform implementation.
