### Failure of the present approach to IT
Healthcare systems around the world
are under increasing pressure and
while there is a widespread belief that
digital technologies have the potential
to have a transformational impact, as
they have in other sectors we are yet to
see this in health and care. This failure
flows from the complexity (technical,
cultural, and regulatory) of the health
and care environment which creates
insurmountable barriers for the sort of
innovative start-ups that have been the
engine of transformation in other sectors.

There is a strong and growing view that
open platforms represent a solution,
lowering the barrier of entry into the
market and through this, supporting
the injection of innovation.

### An 11% saving of national healthcare costs
McKinsey and Co have projected that
health and care systems implementing
an open innovation platform can save
more than 11% of total national healthcare
costs, [a view supported by others](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/how-healthcare-systems-can-become-digital-health-leaders).

### Open platforms supporting 12 million patients already exist!
There are a number of large-scale
open platforms implementations
supporting 12 million patients built
in compliance with the HL7 FHIR,
SNOMED CT, openEHR and IHE-XDS
standards, delivering open platforms
at scale across the globe. We should
follow suit in the UK, building on the
pioneering work of NHS Digital supported
by Code4Health, Ripple Foundation
and others using these standards.

### Why does the status quo inhibit new entrants?
The complexity of both the health and care
environment and the data means that the
likelihood of a new entrant succeeding is
significantly less than in other sectors.
Any new product must integrate with existing
systems and share data with them. Here the
proliferation of non-standard interfaces and
data formats and the difficulty of getting
information and cooperation from existing
vendors make this an often impossible task.
In addition, regulatory barriers relating
to safety, information governance and
cybersecurity which are necessarily higher
in health and care than many other sectors,
place a further burden on new entrants.
These combine with a conservative, risk
averse culture and the horrors of public
sector procurement to make health and
care an extraordinarily difficult market
for a new entrant to get a foothold in.

### An open platform breaks the mould!
Open platforms liberate both data and
applications making them portable
and interoperable across different
platform implementations.

### Away with vendor lock-in!
An open platform is based on open standards.
So any application built for an open platform,
will operate on any open platform.

The open platforms approach is vendor and
technology neutral, eliminates lock-in, facilitates
innovation and competition, and forces vendors
to compete on quality, value, and service.

### What does an open platform look like?
An open platform will provide the
infrastructure and services that are wholly
based on openly published standards.

An open platform implementation will
exist in a secure cloud environment
exposing the services that application
developers need to securely store, share
and process data. It will enable them to
access and consume knowledge and
resources via a set of standardised open
Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). This frees the application
developer to focus on what they are
good at - creating applications!

There are potentially many hundreds
of possible platform services, but a
minimum viable platform needs only
support a handful of services based
on the core standards of HL7 FHIR,
SNOMED CT, openEHR and IHE-XDS.

### The 8 principles of an open platform
An open platform adheres to the
following eight principles:

1. Open Standards Based
1. Shared Common Information Models
1. Supporting Application Portability
1. Federatable
1. Vendor and Technology Neutral
1. Supporting Open Data
1. Providing Open APIs
1. Operability (as in DevOps)

### Information Governance and Cyber Security
There are many well recognised
challenges presented by IG and cyber
security. IG is a significant barrier both
for new entrant developers, thereby
slowing the injection of innovation into
the health and care market. Many of the
existing systems in health and care were
designed as on-premise installations
with no or limited internet connectivity.
Wider exposure to the internet can present
significant IG cyber security challenges.
There is also growing public concern
about privacy, how patients’ data is
used, and the control they have over it.

An open platform approach can
help address these challenges by
providing tools and services to deal
with IG and security issues so the
app developer does not have to.

### Vision
The endgame is to create an open
ecosystem that will drive competition
at the application, service and platform
levels. There will be no vendor lockin. The end user will be able to select a
unique set of applications drawn from
multiple vendors, where each application
will meet the end user’s unique needs,
and where each application will work
seamlessly together. The user will
make their selection on the basis of
quality, value and performance.

All data will be held in open,
shareable and computable formats,
where the applications, services and
platforms are all substitutable.

### Next Steps
Healthcare in general and the NHS
in particular have needed a target
architecture for some time. We have a set
of open standards (HL7 FHIR, SNOMED CT,
openEHR and IHE-XDS) that have been
shown to work well together for health
and care. We propose that open platforms
based on these standards should form the
basis for a target architecture for the UK
that aligns with global developments and
which has been successfully implemented
elsewhere (see section 7.3.5.1 below).

### Aims of this document
This document proposes a definition
of an open platform and the principles
that should be met by those who wish
to claim they have an open platform.
The document also seeks to identify
the issues that need to be resolved to
promote the growth of an open digital
ecosystem for health and social care
and how these might be addressed.
