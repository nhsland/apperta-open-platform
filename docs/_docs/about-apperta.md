The Apperta Foundation is a not-for-profit community interest company supported by NHS
England and NHS Digital led by clinicians to promote open systems and standards for digital
health and social care.

We want to make the data, information and knowledge in IT systems open, shareable and
computable to facilitate the creation of innovative digital services to transform the delivery of
health and social care.
