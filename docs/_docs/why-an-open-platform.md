The complexity of the health and
care environment is a major barrier
to change creating a high, often
insurmountable, barrier to entry
for innovative market entrants.

If we are to encourage innovation
we need to lower this barrier and
believe than by creating an open
platform that offloads some of this
complexity from individual developers
to the platform we can stimulate the
innovation and change we seek..

### Complexity
A major reason for failure of digital
technology within the health and care
sector is its unparalleled complexity
compared to other sectors and the
failure of policy makers to recognise
this complexity. There are many
dimensions to this complexity including:

- The data: clinical and care data is complex. To create true “interoperability”, an open approach is required for defining data models;
- The decision process, due to the number and varieties of types of parties involved in health and care
- Non-determinance: there are generally no simple rules based approaches that can be applied to delivering health and care; and
- Information governance. Much of the data is personal, and exchange and storage of information needs to be undertaken applying strict and legally enforceable rules.

Health and care is complex, while other
sectors are simple or just complicated.
we draw this distinction based on
the definitions from the [Cynefin
Framework](http://cognitive-edge.com/) and [work based on it the
health context](https://frectal.com/book/chaos-complex-complicated-simple-and-cynefin/) by Dr Tony Shannon.

In summary:

- Simple and complicated systems
are deterministic: we can predict
how changing a system’s inputs and
parameters will affect the system’s
behaviour. Complicated systems can
be fully understood by their repeated
decomposition until we are left with
a set of simple, easily understood
components. Modern engineering
practice is highly capable of dealing
with very complicated systems.
- In complex systems we can’t predict
how changing a system’s inputs and
parameters will affect the system’s
behaviour. Complex systems
exhibit emergent properties, not
apparent in the system’s components
parts. Attempts to manage them
as complicated systems produce
unexpected and unpredictable results.
The key is to identify key patterns
at play within the complexity and
harness those patterns. An example
is the clinical process in healthcare
and the process orientation of
the openEHR architecture.

### The engine of change
**Startups, created by innovative
individuals, are generally the engines
for innovation and transformation.**
The complexity within health and
care encompassing technical, cultural
and regulatory dimensions means that
small companies are unable to get a
foothold in this market sector. The
number and complexity of the issues
that have to be addressed to create a
minimal viable product is such that
it very difficult to adequately address
them and breakout from promising
prototype to minimum viable product.

### The Role of Platforms
There are numerous examples in markets
outside health and care, where the
pre-existence of a platform has been
responsible for stimulating IT innovation.
This includes the [Sabre platform](https://www.sabre.com/our-technologies/platform-services/) in travel,
[SWIFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication) in payment services and [iOS](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-11/) and
[Android](https://www.android.com/) in relation to mobile apps.

The pre-existence of a platform
provides the information infrastructure
to developers so their focus is then
solely on what they are good at. This
is in creating new and innovative user
solutions, exploiting the information to
which platforms provides ready access.

The platform deals with onerous
problems such as interoperability,
information governance, cybersecurity
and business continuity leaving app
developer to focus on their applications,
functionality, and design. In this way,
the existence of platforms speed up
development and stimulate innovation.

### Who should own the Platform?
Thought leaders within health and
care have recognised the need for a
platform approach for over 20 years. The
initial approach was to adopt platforms
based on proprietary standards, with
companies seeking to own the platform..
This approach has been tried and
abandoned by most players (includes
large companies (e.g. Microsoft
with Healthvault and other wildly
ambitious start-ups). Most parties have
acknowledged that, due to the combined
pressures from competitors, customers
and regulators, that there is unlikely to
be a winner and that It is preferable to
support the creation of an open platform
and seek commercial opportunities
elsewhere in the value chain.
We see evidence for growing support for
open platforms with initiatives like the
[Health Services Platform Consortium](http://hspconsortium.org/) and
[Commonwell Health Alliance](http://www.commonwellalliance.org/) in the USA,
and the adoption of the open platform
standards [openEHR](http://www.openehr.org/) and [IHE-XDS](http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php/Cross-Enterprise_Document_Sharing) at scale
in many places across the globe. As many
come to the conclusion that the problem
is too big for even the largest players to
solve with proprietary approaches and
that only an open approach towards a
digital healthcare commons, that allows
for cooperation to address the complexity
of health and care can succeed.
