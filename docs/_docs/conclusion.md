### Recommendations and Next Steps
We suggest that efforts towards an open platform already underway across the NHS
and the wider world have all the hallmarks of a grassroots movement for change and so
suggest the following steps to catalyse the efforts of those stakeholders involved.

1. Establish a clinically led **working
group**, initially across the UK & Ireland,
to progress this mission, working to
align community efforts towards the
open platform goal worldwide. The
healthcare open platform working
group should involve representatives
from healthcare organisations and
suppliers.
1. Establish a **custodian** to maintain the
definition of an open platform standard
presented within this document and
the standards adopted or created that
flow from it. We suggest that we, the
Apperta Foundation are well placed to
assume this function..
1. Define and prioritise additional
**platform services** that will add value
to the open platform standard (those
identified in section 6 and others
identified by the community).
1. Identify and if need be develop open
APIs for additional services based on
the [openAPI spec](https://www.openapis.org/). We suggest that
INTEROPen is one of number of key
organisations that could proactively
contribute to this work..
1. Establish a clinically led service for
the development of **clinical content**
definitions for the UK as part of an
international collaboration based
on openEHR and SNOMED CT
Terminology. We suggest that the
[Professional Records Standards Body
(PRSB)](https://theprsb.org/) could perform this role within the
UK.
1. Adopt and support the development
of **open source components** towards
a reference implementation of an
open platform to stimulate the global
ecosystem..
1. Proactively engage key governmental
bodies as key enablers in this change,
who should seek to build out this
infrastructure with related advocacy,
support, resource and funding.
1. Progress the related [1% Open Digital
Platform Challenge Fund](http://ripple.foundation/2017/01/open-digital-platform-challenge-fund/) mechanism
across the UK, Ireland and beyond
to further stimulate the market
towards this open platform future for
healthcare.

As the healthcare world faces
unprecedented challenge and pressures,
the move towards an open platform in
healthcare is already underway. While
the international leaders in the field
are forging ahead, the next wave of first
followers have a crucial role to play to step
up the pace of change.,

This paper is aimed at providing the
thought leadership needed to stimulate
debate and connect the health and care
community towards sharing ideas,
integrated action,
and building support to fulfill this mission.
