An open platform approach raises a
number of issues and opportunities in
relation to information governance and
cyber security.

There are increasing concerns with regard
to the way personal health data is shared
both for the direct care of the individual
and for secondary purposes. The use of
an open platform in and of itself does not
mean either a more liberal or restrictive
approach to information sharing. However,
an open platform can provide facilities
make it easier to control and manage the
sharing of information and the protection
of patient privacy.

Many of the existing systems in health
and care were designed when such
system would be hosted on-premise with
no connectivity beyond the physical estate
of the organisation which they served.
APIs on system (if they existed at all) were
designed for the use of trusted developers
working within the organisation and
certainly not to be exposed to a broader
community of developers via the Internet,
they rely heavily on physical security for
their cybersecurity.

Over recent years we have seen the
growth of the Internet and increasing
pressure from Government for tax-payer
funded services to take advantage of the
cost benefits of cloud computing to open
up their systems to innovation new ways
of working.

These changes promise considerable
benefits, but with it go risks than need to
be carefully managed.

There is also growing public concern about
privacy, how their data is used and the
control they have over it, which regulatory
changes (notably the forthcoming General
Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).

In particular, Article 20 of the GDPR
stipulates the need for Data Portability,
which has clear resonance with a push
towards open standards in healthcare
records;

> The data subject shall have the right to
receive the personal data concerning him
or her, which he or she has provided to a
controller, in a structured, commonly used
and machine-readable format and have
the right to transmit those data to another
controller without hindrance from the
controller to which the personal data has
been provided

Finally, a cloud based open platform has
the potential to create novel solutions
that don’t easily fit well with existing
regulatory frameworks (e.g. co-produced
PHR and multi-organisational records
under shared governance.)

An open platform approach can help
address these challenges in a number
of ways:
* By providing platform service to
address a number of IG issues, thus
relieving the application developer
from the burden. For example:
  * Identity assurance
  * Attribute based access control
  * Authentication
  * Federated consent management
  * Audit trails
* By providing protected gateways to
underlying systems, removing much of
the cyber security burden from them
* Facilitate legacy connectivity as
described in section 6.6.
* By virtue of it’s open data format, easily
satisfy the data portability requirement
of GDPR
