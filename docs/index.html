              <p>There has been growing global interest in the concept of an Open Digital Platform for health and care based on open standards.</p>
              <p>We have produced a document called “Defining an Open Platform” to make the case for open platforms and lay out a blueprint for an open platform architecture at a level of detail that would allow any willing party to build a first generation implementation of an open platform that would be interoperable with any other. Our proposal is based on HL7 FHIR, SNOMED-CT, IHE-XDS and openEHR and draws on pioneering work globally and in the UK that have proven how these standards can be used to build an open platform.</p>
              <p>The document was launched at EHI Live on Tuesday 31 Oct in the NHS Digital Theatre at 09.30. We welcome you comments.</p>
