Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

4. Proposed Definition of an
	

Open Platform

4.1 Introduction
When trying to define an open platform it
is necessary to understand the needs of
the different stakeholder groups, as well as
the generic and underlying functionalities
of health and care software applications.

3.	 Manage the consumption of care
resources - (this includes creating,
consuming, processing and updating
information about them - i.e. referrals,
orders, treatments, and services).
Most applications don’t directly create
knowledge, but by collecting data through
the care process they can support
activities that refine current knowledge
and create new knowledge.

4.2 What do Health and Care
Applications do?
At an abstract level all health and care
applications do either or both of the
following:
1.	 Support the processes that deliver care;
and/or
2.	 Collect and/or analyse data to support
the delivery of care.
At a functional level, all health and care
applications:
1.	 Create, consume and update
information about the subjects of care i.e. the health and care record;
2.	 Consume and process knowledge i.e. data, metadata, care pathways,
decision support rules and heuristics,
etc.; and

4.3 How do Users want to use
Applications?
An individual user who is involved in
the health and care system (patient or
service user, family or informal carer or
health and care worker or professional)
would like to be able to choose a set of
applications from multiple vendors that
best support their needs.
An open platform enables applications
from multiple vendors to be orchestrated
to work together to meet an individual
user’s needs.
