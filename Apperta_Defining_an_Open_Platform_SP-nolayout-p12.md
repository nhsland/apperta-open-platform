Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

In summary:

number and complexity of the issues
that have to be addressed to create a
minimal viable product is such that
it very difficult to adequately address
them and breakout from promising
prototype to minimum viable product.

* Simple and complicated systems
are deterministic: we can predict
how changing a system’s inputs and
parameters will affect the system’s
behaviour. Complicated systems can
be fully understood by their repeated
decomposition until we are left with
a set of simple, easily understood
components. Modern engineering
practice is highly capable of dealing
with very complicated systems.

3.3 The Role of Platforms

* In complex systems we can’t predict
how changing a system’s inputs and
parameters will affect the system’s
behaviour. Complex systems
exhibit emergent properties, not
apparent in the system’s components
parts. Attempts to manage them
as complicated systems produce
unexpected and unpredictable results.
The key is to identify key patterns
at play within the complexity and
harness those patterns. An example
is the clinical process in healthcare
and the process orientation of
the openEHR architecture.

3.2 The engine of change
Startups, created by innovative
individuals, are generally the engines
for innovation and transformation.
The complexity within health and
care encompassing technical, cultural
and regulatory dimensions means that
small companies are unable to get a
foothold in this market sector. The

There are numerous examples in markets
outside health and care, where the
pre-existence of a platform has been
responsible for stimulating IT innovation.
This includes the Sabre platform in travel,
SWIFT in payment services and IoS and
Android in relation to mobile apps.
The pre-existence of a platform
provides the information infrastructure
to developers so their focus is then
solely on what they are good at. This
is in creating new and innovative user
solutions, exploiting the information to
which platforms provides ready access.
The platform deals with onerous
problems such as interoperability,
information governance, cybersecurity
and business continuity leaving app
developer to focus on their applications,
functionality, and design. In this way,
the existence of platforms speed up
development and stimulate innovation.

3.4 Who should own
the Platform?
Thought leaders within health and
care have recognised the need for a
platform approach for over 20 years. The
initial approach was to adopt platforms
