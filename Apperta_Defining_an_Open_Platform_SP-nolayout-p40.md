# Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

## 9. Minimum Viable Open Platform (MVP)

Here there is a lesson to be learnt from a related global initiative, known as [openHIE](https://ohie.org/), who are advocating a standards based, implementable and interchangeable [openHIE Architecture](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/OpenHIE+Architecture) alongside [key related open source reference technologies](https://wiki.ohie.org/display/documents/OpenHIE+Architecture) to craft a Minimum Viable Open Platform for health and care.

We believe this blend of open standards and open source to be the right way forward and recommend such an approach to be adopted more widely. In the context of the healthcare market in the UK/Ireland/Europe, we believe a Minimum Viable open Platform (MVP) requires relatively few of the services described below. The essential elements are:

* Authentication services;
* Master Patient Index (demographic service);
* Service Directory (staff and services) and
* Clinical Data Repository (CDR) based on openEHR

So we simply endorse and extend the approach taken by openHIE towards a reference implementation of an open platform architecture. In addition, we advocate, incorporating an additional key element i.e. an open standards (openEHR) based CDR, which is already being deployed around the globe..

In the UK, [inidus](https://inidus.com/) has built the Code4Health Platform supported by NHS Digital. This is fully consistent with the open principles outlined within this document, standing as a MVP of such an open platform. It has been made freely available to the developer community and has already proven a number of prototype applications.

A second notable MVP is that of the [Ripple Foundation](http://ripple.foundation/). This incorporates an open source UX/UI framework along with an open source integration framework on an open source openEHR Clinical Data Repository..
