## Foreword

Health and care faces a crisis, with growing demands and spiralling costs. In other sectors we have seen digital technology transform the way services are delivered, but so far, despite substantial investment, such transformational effects have eluded us in health and care.

The Apperta Foundation believes innovative technologies can achieve the transformation that we seek, yet if we want a different outcome from future investment we are going to have to do things differently and break away from 20th Century technology and business models that lock data in proprietary formats and customers into obsolete systems.

Change requires innovation and innovation does not come from the incumbent players. If we look to other sectors we can see that it was Amazon not Foyles, eBay not Exchange and Mart, Wikipedia not Encyclopedia Britannica that transformed their sectors through digital innovation.

In health and care, the complexity of the environment in terms of the informatics, regulation governance and culture make the barriers to entry for innovative new players much higher than
they were in other sectors In health and care we have seen no new entrants to the market reach discernible scale in the last twenty-five years.

We believe that open digital platforms based on open standards can lower barriers to entry, stimulate innovation and enable successful startups rapidly get to scale.

This is not just our view but one shared by global experts and the major consultancies. More than this, it is an approach that has already been proven at scale elsewhere.

We want to creatApperta_Defining_an_Open_Platform_SP-nolayout-p40e an ecosystem where health and care communities can deploy and scale up an open platform implementation confident that the data they store in it and the applications that run on it are portable to any other implementation. This requires an unambiguous definition of what we mean by an open platform and the standards on which it should be based.

This document is an attempt to propose such a definition, based on standards that have been proven to work worldwide including HL7 FHIR, SNOMED-CT, IHE_XDS and openEHR.

We put this document forward as a blueprint to enable and support those pioneers keen to progress on the journey to take digital health and care into the 21st Century.
