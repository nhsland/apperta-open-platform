Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

other than Wordpress, and the same can
be expected in health and care.

provides a starting point of good practice
and principles.

7.4.3 A starting point for a health
and care frameworksâ€¦..

While these efforts have explored new
UX possibilities in healthcare, there
is a paucity of open source UX/UI
frameworks that have been implemented
for healthcare.To address this, the Ripple
Foundation - (non profit organisation who
are promoting an open integrated health
and care platform compatible with the
definition proposed in this document)
have built and supported several related
components including an open source
patterns & component based UX/
UI framework called PulseTile which
appears to be a leading example of the
way ahead.

There are a number of generic frameworks
that can be used to create a consistent
UI/UX. While these would require work to
satisfy the full needs of health and care,
they offer significant flexibility and could
be augmented with specific health and
care specific UI components. Frameworks
of note include:

* Bootstrap;
* Angular JS;
* React;
* Semantic UI

What all of these frameworks have in
common is that they are open source
projects created by leading Internet
companies (Twitter, Facebook, Google
and Pivotal) all of whom recognise that
by open sourcing their tools they gain
much more than they give away. These
companies also recognise the need to
do so in a way that allows commercial
exploitation of the frameworks by others
(each framework is released using a
commercial friendly licence).
Some years ago there was some beautiful
UX work done in the US as part a Health
Design Challenge, which yielded a range
of new UX ideas for healthcare.
