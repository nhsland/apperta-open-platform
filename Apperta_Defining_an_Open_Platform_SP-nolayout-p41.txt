Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

10. Implementing an Open

Platform Ecosystem

Delivering the vision of an open platform
is not about creating a single instance of
a platform, but rather it is about creating
an open platform ecosystem where a
number of platform providers compete for
business with each other.
There are various models that might
emerge for the creation of an open
platform ecosystem. These include:
•	 The establishment of an open health
and care commons/marketplace for
open platform oriented components
and services. The 1% Open Digital
Challenge Fund push across the UK
and Ireland has already evidenced
the appetite in the market for such a
change. The Digital Square that is just
emerging from the internationally
leading PATH NGO who lead on
openHIE is one other thought leading
example.
•	 Local health and care communities
providing a platform instance for their
populations - This model may well fit
well within the UK context, with the
Sustainability and Transformation
Partnerships (STPs) areas being the

starting point (in England). This
mirrors the current approach taken by
STPs for Integrated Digital Care Record
systems;
•	 Individual patients deciding where
they want to store their health data and
to whom they grant access - This is a
patient centric approach and mirrors
emerging Personal Health Record
(PHR) systems.
•	 A focus on a particular subset of
patients, for example those with a
specific disease. This mirrors current
approaches with disease registries.
These models could be combined in
various ways. There are also likely to be
other candidate models.. Some models
may result in data for the same individual
being stored in multiple places. In this
case, which can be understood as a
federation of open platform instances, an
ecosystem record locator service would
enable applications to find the relevant
platform instance to retrieve or store the
individual’s data.
