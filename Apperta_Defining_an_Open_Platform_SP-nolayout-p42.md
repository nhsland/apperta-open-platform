Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

11. Conclusion,

Recommendations and Next Steps
We suggest that efforts towards an open platform already underway across the NHS
and the wider world have all the hallmarks of a grassroots movement for change and so
suggest the following steps to catalyse the efforts of those stakeholders involved.
1. Establish a clinically led working
group, initially across the UK & Ireland,
to progress this mission, working to
align community efforts towards the
open platform goal worldwide. The
healthcare open platform working
group should involve representatives
from healthcare organisations and
suppliers.
1. Establish a custodian to maintain the
definition of an open platform standard
presented within this document and
the standards adopted or created that
flow from it. We suggest that we, the
Apperta Foundation are well placed to
assume this function..
1. Define and prioritise additional
platform services that will add value
to the open platform standard (those
identified in section 6 and others
identified by the community).

1. Identify and if need be develop open
APIs for additional services based on
the openAPI spec. We suggest that
INTEROPen is one of number of key
organisations that could proactively
contribute to this work..
1. Establish a clinically led service for
the development of clinical content
definitions for the UK as part of an
international collaboration based
on openEHR and SNOMED CT
Terminology. We suggest that the
Professional Records Standards Body
PRSB could perform this role within the
UK.
1. Adopt and support the development
of open source components towards
a reference implementation of an
open platform to stimulate the global
ecosystem..
