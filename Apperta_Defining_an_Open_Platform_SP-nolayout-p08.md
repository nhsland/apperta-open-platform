Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

What does an open platform look like?
An open platform will provide the
infrastructure and services that are wholly
based on openly published standards.
An open platform implementation will
exist in a secure cloud environment
exposing the services that application
developers need to securely store, share
and process data. It will enable them to
access and consume knowledge and
resources via a set of standardised open
Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs). This frees the application
developer to focus on what they are
good at - creating applications!
There are potentially many hundreds
of possible platform services, but a
minimum viable platform needs only
support a handful of services based
on the core standards of HL7 FHIR,
SNOMED CT, openEHR and IHE-XDS.
The 8 principles of an open platform
An open platform adheres to the
following eight principles:

1. Open Standards Based
1. Shared Common Information Models
1. Supporting Application Portability
1. Federatable
1. Vendor and Technology Neutral
1. Supporting Open Data
1. Providing Open APIs
1. Operability (as in DevOps)

Information Governance
and Cyber Security
There are many well recognised
challenges presented by IG and cyber
security. IG is a significant barrier both
for new entrant developers, thereby
slowing the injection of innovation into
the health and care market. Many of the
existing systems in health and care were
designed as on-premise installations
with no or limited internet connectivity.
Wider exposure to the internet can present
significant IG cyber security challenges.
There is also growing public concern
about privacy, how patients’ data is
used, and the control they have over it.
An open platform approach can
help address these challenges by
providing tools and services to deal
with IG and security issues so the
app developer does not have to.

# Vision

The endgame is to create an open
ecosystem that will drive competition
at the application, service and platform
levels. There will be no vendor lockin. The end user will be able to select a
unique set of applications drawn from
multiple vendors, where each application
will meet the end user’s unique needs,
and where each application will work
seamlessly together. The user will
make their selection on the basis of
quality, value and performance.
