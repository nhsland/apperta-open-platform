Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

2. Introduction
While IT systems are pervasive across
health and care organisations, health
care systems around the world are
under pressure and have not generated
the widespread transformation
found in other market sectors.
This is despite the broad
acknowledgement that digital
technology has the potential to
offer significant benefits.
Support for the potential benefits of an
open platform approach is growing with

digital pioneers3, large IT and consultancy
companies4, and national health systems5
recognising the potential benefits. This
progress is hampered by a lack of a
clear definition of what does and does
not constitute an open platform and a
lack of clarity on the issues that need
to be addressed to make progress.
This document proposes a definition
of an open platform and the principles
that should be met by those who wish
to claim they have an open platform.
Comments and further contributions
are invited from interested parties.
This document also seeks to identify
the issues that need to be resolved to
promote the growth of an open digital
ecosystem for health and social care
and how these might be addressed.
