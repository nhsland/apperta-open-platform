Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

1. Executive Summary
Failure of the present approach to IT

An 11% saving of national healthcare costs

Healthcare systems around the world
are under increasing pressure and
while there is a widespread belief that
digital technologies have the potential
to have a transformational impact, as
they have in other sectors we are yet to
see this in health and care. This failure
flows from the complexity (technical,
cultural, and regulatory) of the health
and care environment which creates
insurmountable barriers for the sort of
innovative start-ups that have been the
engine of transformation in other sectors.

McKinsey and Co have projected that
health and care systems implementing
an open innovation platform can save
more than 11% of total national healthcare
costs, a view supported by others1.

There is a strong and growing view that
open platforms represent a solution,
lowering the barrier of entry into the
market and through this, supporting
the injection of innovation.

Open platforms supporting 12
million patients already exist!
There are a number of large-scale
open platforms implementations
supporting 12 million patients built
in compliance with the HL7 FHIR,
SNOMED CT, openEHR and IHE-XDS
standards, delivering open platforms
at scale across the globe. We should
follow suit in the UK, building on the
pioneering work of NHS Digital supported
by Code4Health, Ripple Foundation
and others using these standards.
