Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

Why does the status quo inhibit new entrants?
The complexity of both the health and care
environment and the data means that the
likelihood of a new entrant succeeding is
significantly less than in other sectors.
Any new product must integrate with existing
systems and share data with them. Here the
proliferation of non-standard interfaces and
data formats and the difficulty of getting
information and cooperation from existing
vendors make this an often impossible task.
In addition, regulatory barriers relating
to safety, information governance and
cybersecurity which are necessarily higher
in health and care than many other sectors,
place a further burden on new entrants.
These combine with a conservative, risk
averse culture and the horrors of public
sector procurement to make health and
care an extraordinarily difficult market
for a new entrant to get a foothold in.
An open platform breaks the mould!
Open platforms liberate both data and
applications making them portable
and interoperable across different
platform implementations.
Away with vendor lock-in!
An open platform is based on open standards.
So any application built for an open platform,
will operate on any open platform.
The open platforms approach is vendor and
technology neutral, eliminates lock-in, facilitates
innovation and competition, and forces vendors
to compete on quality, value, and service.
