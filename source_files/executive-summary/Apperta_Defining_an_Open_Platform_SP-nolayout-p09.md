Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

All data will be held in open,
shareable and computable formats,
where the applications, services and
platforms are all substitutable.
Next Steps
Healthcare in general and the NHS
in particular have needed a target
architecture for some time. We have a set
of open standards (HL7 FHIR, SNOMED CT,
openEHR and IHE-XDS) that have been
shown to work well together for health
and care. We propose that open platforms
based on these standards should form the
basis for a target architecture for the UK
that aligns with global developments and
which has been successfully implemented
elsewhere (see section 7.3.5.1 below).
Aims of this document
This document proposes a definition
of an open platform and the principles
that should be met by those who wish
to claim they have an open platform.
The document also seeks to identify
the issues that need to be resolved to
promote the growth of an open digital
ecosystem for health and social care
and how these might be addressed.
