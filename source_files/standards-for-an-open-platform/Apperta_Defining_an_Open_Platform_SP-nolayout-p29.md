standards. This confusion is compounded
by the fact that leading standards like HL7
FHIR and openEHR address both technical
and content issues. Nevertheless, the
way they address this is quite different,
with FHIR focusing on a limited range of
content. The consequence is that FHIR
lacks the mature community, governance
and tooling for large scale content
development and maintenance.
Content is ideally defined in a way that
is agnostic to any particular technical
representation. This is particularly
important as content standards tend to
be convergent and stable over the longterm whereas technical standards are
constantly changing.
