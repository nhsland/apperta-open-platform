6.5.3 Clinical Calculators
There are a large number of calculations
made in medicine. Some are simple and
easily handled by developers. Others
are difficult and error-prone, requiring
complex look-ups and adjustments
against multiple factors or normative
datasets (e.g. paediatric weight centiles)
and some are safety critical (e.g. opiates
equivalence calculations).

This data could usefully be made available
via an API. This has been recognised by
the The Organisation Data Service (ODS)
Strategy 2015-2020. However, to-date, there
has been no commitment by the NHS to
implement this strategy recommendation
which will be necessary if these data are
to be made available as an open platform
service.

Quality assured clinical calculators can be
provided as a platform service, removing
both the complexity of the calculation and
management of any associated risks from
the developer.

6.5.6 Drug Information

6.5.4 TRUD Data
The Technology Reference data Update
Distribution site run by NHS Digital
contains a large number of sets of
reference data. These datasets are
available for download and most can
be used free of charge after a simple
registration process.
However many of these could be made
more conveniently available via an API on
the open platform.

Many applications require information
about medicines. The requirement for
drug information includes simple static
data (such as form, strength route and
pack sizes) and more sophisticated active
decision support (relating to such things
as contraindications, interactions, crosssensitivities and dosage). There are freely
available sources for much of the static
data likely to be required (e.g. NHS dm+d).
For comprehensive information, it is
necessary to turn to commercial providers
some of whom have suitable APIs. These
APIs could be made available via an open
platform

6.5.5 Organisation Data Service
The Organisation Data Service run by
NHS Digital contains data about NHS
and partner organisations. This data
is available for download in a machine
readable form (some of the most detailed
information is only available to NHS
users).
