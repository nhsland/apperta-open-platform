## 10. Implementing an Open Platform Ecosystem

Delivering the vision of an open platform is not about creating a single instance of a platform, but rather it is about creating an open platform ecosystem where a number of platform providers compete for business with each other.

There are various models that might emerge for the creation of an open platform ecosystem. These include:
* The establishment of an open health and care commons/marketplace for open platform oriented components and services. The 1% Open Digital Challenge Fund push across the UK and Ireland has already evidenced the appetite in the market for such a change. The Digital Square that is just emerging from the internationally leading PATH NGO who lead on openHIE is one other thought leading example.
* Local health and care communities providing a platform instance for their populations - This model may well fit well within the UK context, with the Sustainability and Transformation Partnerships (STPs) areas being the starting point (in England). This mirrors the current approach taken by STPs for Integrated Digital Care Record systems;
* Individual patients deciding where they want to store their health data and to whom they grant access - This is a patient centric approach and mirrors emerging Personal Health Record (PHR) systems.
* A focus on a particular subset of patients, for example those with a specific disease. This mirrors current approaches with disease registries.

These models could be combined in various ways. There are also likely to be other candidate models.. Some models may result in data for the same individual being stored in multiple places. In this case, which can be understood as a federation of open platform instances, an ecosystem record locator service would enable applications to find the relevant platform instance to retrieve or store the individualâ€™s data.
