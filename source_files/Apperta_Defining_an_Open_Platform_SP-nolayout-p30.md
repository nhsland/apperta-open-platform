Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

7.2 Open API Standards
An open platform appears to applications
as nothing more than a set of open APIs
which enable them to access platform
services.
The endgame for an open platform
architecture is to have a complete set
of platform microservices for all those
things that can usefully be offloaded to
the platform by the developersâ€™ app. Each
microservice will include a standard
and stable open API expressed using
the standards defined by the Open API
Initiative. The potential number of
platform microservices is potentially
large (maybe some hundreds to a few
thousand). However, the problem is a longtailed one, which means a open platform
with a small number of services (less than
10) can provide high utility to developers.

7.2.1 Defining an open API
In defining an open API, an open platform
will require to specify the technical
operation of the API (this is a generic
issue) and the actions that the API
will support (this is a domain specific/
flavoured issue):
(1) Technical Operation
API technologies are continually changing
but the current preference amongst
application developers is for REST APIs
carrying a JSON payload. This would be
the current choice of API technology for
an open platform.
