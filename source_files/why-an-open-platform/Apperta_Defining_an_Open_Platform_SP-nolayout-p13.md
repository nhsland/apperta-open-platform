Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

based on proprietary standards, with
companies seeking to own the platform..
This approach has been tried and
abandoned by most players (includes
large companies (e.g. Microsoft
with Healthvault and other wildly
ambitious start-ups). Most parties have
acknowledged that, due to the combined
pressures from competitors, customers
and regulators, that there is unlikely to
be a winner and that It is preferable to
support the creation of an open platform
and seek commercial opportunities
elsewhere in the value chain.
We see evidence for growing support for
open platforms with initiatives like the
Health Services Platform Consortium and
Commonwell Health Alliance in the USA,
and the adoption of the open platform
standards openEHR and IHE-XDS at scale
in many places across the globe. As many
come to the conclusion that the problem
is too big for even the largest players to
solve with proprietary approaches and
that only an open approach towards a
digital healthcare commons, that allows
for cooperation to address the complexity
of health and care can succeed.
