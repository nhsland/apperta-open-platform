Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

7. Standards for an Open Platform
Open standards are critical to achieving
the central aim of an open platform - that
is, portability for data and substitutability
for applications so that neither gets locked
into a particular vendor's platform.
This requires standards in two areas:

* Open Interface standards (APIs); and
* Content standards.

Before turning attention to these
standards, we will consider the difference
between technical and content-based
standards.

7.1 An Understanding of
Technical vs Content-based
Standards…..
Defining suitable open API standards is
primarily a technical problem and is not
a difficult problem to address. There are
well established standards from the Open
API Initiative. APIs for an open platform
should be defined using these standards.

Content Standards
Content standards define the way in
which the content (often called “clinical
content”) is represented in systems and
interactions between them. Content
standards can be applied to the way
information is stored in an electronic
record or to the payload of a message
or API. Content standards typically
describe how information describing a
particular concept (e.g. A blood pressure
or dementia assessment) should be
formatted, structured and coded to make it
unambiguously computable.
Defining content is primarily a clinical11
rather than a technical problem. It is
concerned with getting clinicians to agree
what they mean by a given concept, the
parameters associated with the concept
and how they are represented. This is
work that needs to be led by clinicians
supported by informaticians.
There is much confusion in the area of
interoperability in health and care that
flows from the failure to understand the
difference between technical and content
