Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

Here too an open platform provider can act
as a broker much simplifying this problem
for the app developer, app user, and data
controller by providing identity assurance
and authentication by either acting as
a trusted third party (itself providing
certifications relating to the app or app
user) or in a trust-agnostic mode (where
it simply provides a gateway to external
source of trust). In addition, by proxying
connections to legacy systems, a platform
can protect underlying systems from
damaging behaviour by an app (either
malicious or unintentional) eliminating
the need for technical accreditation of
apps by end systems vendors
