Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

Health and social care organisations
presently spend significant resources to
both locate and secure suitable resources.
Their methods are commonly manual and
highly inefficient, leading to interruptions
in patient flows, the sub-optimal use
of resources, and avoidable costs and
suffering.
There are potentially a number of platform
services that could be created to assist
with the process of discovering available
resources, allocating them,and scheduling
their use and handling the resultant
financial flows.
There are some existing services that
could be exposed via an open platform of
which the most significant in the NHS for
example is the e-Referral Service.
