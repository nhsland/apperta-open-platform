Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

6. Platform Services
Platform services provide those facilities
needed to build interoperable health and
social care applications. The platform
services offer those things that app
developers cannot or do not want to do
themselves.
A platform provides access to these
services via secure and robust APIs
(Application Programming Interfaces)
while the services themselves are
designed to provide flexible and scalable
access to the resources required.
The number of platform services that
could be provided is unlimited and will
include services to help developers deal
with both generic technical challenges
and challenges specific to the health
and social care environment. However, a
useful platform can be provided with just
a few services. The concept of a Minimal
Viable open Platform (MVP - the minimum
number of services necessary to provide a
viable open platform) see section 9.
This section lists the classes of service
that might be usefully provided on an

open platform in health and social care.

6.1 Identity Assurance,
Authorisation and
Authentication Services
1. Identity Assurance

Identity Assurance is concerned with
establishing that an individual claiming
a particular identity is that person.
Identity Assurance can be extended to
establishing that the individual has the
status or qualifications they claim (e.g. is
a registered health or care professional
licensed to practice in the UK).
Health and care apps are concerned about
the identity assurance of individuals and
their role(s) in health and care. Identity
can be assured at a number of levels and
is typically achieved by the individual
providing various proofs of identity
and qualifications. This can range from
a simple check that an individual has
control over an email address they use to
identify themselves, through to developed
vetting by the security services. For health
