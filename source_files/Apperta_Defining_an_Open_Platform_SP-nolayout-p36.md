Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

7.4 User Interface (UI) and User
Experience (UX) standards and
frameworks
7.4.1 Vision
The vision of an open digital ecosystem
is that any end user will be able to select
a unique set of applications drawn from
multiple vendors, where each applications
will meet the end user’s unique needs,
and where each application will work
seamlessly together. The application
should be:

* Interoperable - Able to share relevant
data between themselves;
* Orchestrated - Work together;
* Form-factor agile - Adapt their UI to the
form-factor of the device they are used
on; and
* UI/UX consistent - Operating with a
common look and feel.

We make the case for open standards,
components and frameworks at the UX/UI
level of an open platform, very well aware
of the generally poor level of usability in
healthcare IT, mindful of the unnecessary
cognitive load this puts on already busy
clinicians at the frontline.
In the same way that stepping into a rental
car generally results in the driver easily
finding the common components required
to steer, accelerate, brake, indicate, etc
as they are placed in a highly consistent
manner across the automotive industry,

we believe there now is a compelling case
for a common usability framework in
healthcare.
Attention to clinical safety is one of the
bywords for good practice in modern
healthcare and any inspection of the
people/process/technology challenge
when seeing the varied UX landscape
across a typical healthcare environment
quickly explains why we have the rate
of medical errors that are so problematic
today.

7.4.2 Achieving the Vision
Achieving this vision of an open digital
ecosystem that has a consistent UX/UI is
non-trivial. It requires the development
of standards and frameworks that will
support developers to build applications
that achieve these objectives.
It is possible to draw analogies here from
other sectors. For example the open
source Wordpress content management
system (CMS) provides a core “platform”
which can be augmented with plug-ins
from multiple vendors (as of May 2017,
there are over 50,000 Wordpress plugins)
to create a unique website. By separating
the UI components into “themes”, a site
built with plugins from multiple vendors
can be given a consistent UI/UX by
applying an appropriate theme of which
there are many thousands to choose from.
The ultimate aim is to see a number of
such frameworks developed that provide
similar capabilities for application
developers in health and care. In the world
of CMSs there are of course frameworks
