Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

7.	 Proactively engage key governmental
bodies as key enablers in this change,
who should seek to build out this
infrastructure with related advocacy,
support, resource and funding.
8.	 Progress the related 1% Open Digital
Platform Challenge Fund mechanism
across the UK, Ireland and beyond
to further stimulate the market
towards this open platform future for
healthcare.
As the healthcare world faces
unprecedented challenge and pressures,
the move towards an open platform in
healthcare is already underway. While
the international leaders in the field
are forging ahead, the next wave of first
followers have a crucial role to play to step
up the pace of change.,
This paper is aimed at providing the
thought leadership needed to stimulate
debate and connect the health and care
community towards sharing ideas,
integrated action,
and building support to fulfill this mission.
We want your views, ideas, support and
