Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

3. Why an Open Platform?
The complexity of the health and
care environment is a major barrier
to change creating a high, often
insurmountable, barrier to entry
for innovative market entrants.

* The decision process, due to the
number and varieties of types of
parties involved in health and care
* Non-determinance: there are
generally no simple rules based
approaches that can be applied to
delivering health and care; and

If we are to encourage innovation
we need to lower this barrier and
believe than by creating an open
platform that offloads some of this
complexity from individual developers
to the platform we can stimulate the
innovation and change we seek..

* Information governance. Much of
the data is personal, and exchange
and storage of information needs
to be undertaken applying strict
and legally enforceable rules.

3.1 Complexity
A major reason for failure of digital
technology within the health and care
sector is its unparalleled complexity
compared to other sectors and the
failure of policy makers to recognise
this complexity. There are many
dimensions to this complexity including:

Health and care is complex, while other
sectors are simple or just complicated.
we draw this distinction based on
the definitions from the Cynefin
Framework and work based on it the
health context by Dr Tony Shannon.

* The data: clinical and care
data is complex. To create true
“interoperability”, an open approach
is required for defining data models;
