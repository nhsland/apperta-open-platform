Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform

8. Information Governance and

Cyber Security

An open platform approach raises a
number of issues and opportunities in
relation to information governance and
cyber security.
There are increasing concerns with regard
to the way personal health data is shared
both for the direct care of the individual
and for secondary purposes. The use of
an open platform in and of itself does not
mean either a more liberal or restrictive
approach to information sharing. However,
an open platform can provide facilities
make it easier to control and manage the
sharing of information and the protection
of patient privacy.
Many of the existing systems in health
and care were designed when such
system would be hosted on-premise with
no connectivity beyond the physical estate
of the organisation which they served.
APIs on system (if they existed at all) were
designed for the use of trusted developers
working within the organisation and
certainly not to be exposed to a broader
community of developers via the Internet,
they rely heavily on physical security for
their cybersecurity.

Over recent years we have seen the
growth of the Internet and increasing
pressure from Government for tax-payer
funded services to take advantage of the
cost benefits of cloud computing to open
up their systems to innovation new ways
of working.
These changes promise considerable
benefits, but with it go risks than need to
be carefully managed.
There is also growing public concern about
privacy, how their data is used and the
control they have over it, which regulatory
changes (notably the forthcoming General
Data Protection Regulations (GDPR).
