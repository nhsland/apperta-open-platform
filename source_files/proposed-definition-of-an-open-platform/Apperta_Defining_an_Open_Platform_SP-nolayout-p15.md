Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

4.6 Proposed Definition
4.4 What do Developers want
from a Platform?
Developers want to focus on writing the
front end applications. They would like to
be able to call upon ready made resources
and services (via API calls) that are
supplied by the platform. These resources
are provided by an open platform as
described above.

4.5 Healthcare Payers and
Providers?
Healthcare payers seek lower costs, better
value and a more agile response from
solution providers to their changing needs.
They wish to be able to choose the best
options from multiple vendors and to be
able to move easily when the best option
changes.
They wish to ensure that they can use
their data as they wish and are not be
constrained by it being locked-in to
proprietary formats or systems.
An open platform facilitates agile
development of healthcare apps and
solutions, takes advantage of the lower
cost of cloud infrastructure, eliminates
vendor lock-in and encourages
competition.

The following definition is based on a one
previously proposed6 with amendments
based on feedback from a number of
interested parties.

In health and care, an open digital
ecosystem can make it easier to
build applications that support
safe, high quality compassionate
care. It allows applications and
services from multiple vendors
to work together for an individual
user whatever their role (e.g.
clinician, patient, carer, social
worker, commissioner, manager,
care worker, etc.) such that there is
a many-to-many substitutability
between applications and services.
In other words, an application
requiring a service can use any
available service provider via
common APIs.
An open ecosystem is vendor and
technology neutral and eliminates
lock-in, facilitates innovation
and forces vendors to compete on
quality, value, and service.
