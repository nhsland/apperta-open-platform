Apperta Foundation - Defining an Open Platform - October 2017

•	 Facilitate legacy connectivity as
described in section 6.6.

In particular, Article 20 of the GDPR
stipulates the need for Data Portability,
which has clear resonance with a push
towards open standards in healthcare
records;
The data subject shall have the right to
receive the personal data concerning him
or her, which he or she has provided to a
controller, in a structured, commonly used
and machine-readable format and have
the right to transmit those data to another
controller without hindrance from the
controller to which the personal data has
been provided

* By virtue of it’s open data format, easily
satisfy the data portability requirement
of GDPR

Finally, a cloud based open platform has
the potential to create novel solutions
that don’t easily fit well with existing
regulatory frameworks (e.g. co-produced
PHR and multi-organisational records
under shared governance.)

* An open platform approach can help
address these challenges in a number
of ways:
* By providing platform service to
address a number of IG issues, thus
relieving the application developer
from the burden. E.g.
  * Identity assurance
  * Attribute based access control
  * Authentication
  * Federated consent management
  * Audit trails
* By providing protected gateways to
underlying systems, removing much of
the cyber security burden from them
